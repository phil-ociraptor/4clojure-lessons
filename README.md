Hello,

I'm trying to put together the most beautiful solutions to 
[4clojure](http://www.4clojure.com) problems.

My methodology has been to follow about 25 people who have finished all 156 
4clojure problems. After I solve each one, I compare my solution to theirs.

With an eye for aesthetics, I try to rewrite my solution and learn from others.

The end result, I hope, will be beautiful solutions that introduce beautiful
ideas in clojure.

I don't intend to cover ALL problems, just the ones I find teachable.

## Folders

There are two:
```
problems/
notes/
```

In problems, I share my favorite solutions, and other good candidates.

In notes, I write about ideas/concepts I was introduced to while solving and 
observing other's solutions to problems.
